      "Appreciation post for @DevDegens We've worked with 3 different dev teams since our launch 2 months ago. All simultaneously and I just have to say these guys are A1. I've noticed since launching this project some development companies will say anything, promise swift work, and be super communicative until you finally pay them. Then you're waiting months with little to no communication. Not these guys. I highly suggest if you're a founder or creator to reach out to them. Both products they have built for us were finished in 2 weeks. They are present everyday with updates and make you feel like they are your own personal in house devs. I tilt my hat to the founder and devs working over there and wish you guys much success.",
